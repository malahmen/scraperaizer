Vercel's AI SDK 5 is a TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with unified LLM integration across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and others). It standardizes complex LLM workflows through two core libraries:  
- **AI SDK Core**: Unified API for text/structured data generation, tool calling, embeddings, and agent creation.  
- **AI SDK UI**: Framework-agnostic hooks for chat interfaces and generative UIs.  

Key benefits: Simplifies cross-provider switching, offers out-of-the-box templates (chatbots, RAG, multi-modal apps), and supports Next.js, Svelte, Vue, and Node.js. Documentation, starter kits, and community resources (GitHub, llms.txt for LLM prompts) are provided.  

*Concise essence: Standardizes and accelerates AI app development with a single API, eliminating provider-specific complexity.*
