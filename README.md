{"name":"AI SDK","purpose":"\n\nVercel's AI SDK is a TypeScript toolkit designed to simplify building AI applications and agents across multiple frameworks (Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, etc.). It standardizes integration with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and others), allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than provider-specific complexities. The SDK includes two core libraries:  \n- **AI SDK Core**: For generating text, structured data, tool calls, and managing models.  \n- **AI SDK UI**: Framework-agnostic hooks for building chatbots and generative UIs.  \nKey features include prompt engineering, streaming, tool calling, embeddings, and support for templates/starter kits (e.g., chatbots, RAG systems). It aims to unify AI development while offering flexibility across providers.","category hints":"Agent, RAG pipelines, Developer Tools","tags":"TypeScript, LLM, Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, Node.js"}
